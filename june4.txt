revised through some commands studied like grub, sed, touch, ln etc.

Watched remaining videos in permissi.mp4, process.mp4, tar.mp4 and studied the commands like chmod, yes, kill, top, free, ls  and how to archive and compress files.

 watched video dirctor.mp4 and got an idea about the dirctories like bin, boot, sbin, usr, etc, home and lib.
 
 The video compile.mp4 is gives the idea how the c compilation takes place through 4 phase process to create a.out file.
 
 watched video gdb.mp4 since I have a previous idea about gdb it was not that difficult and learned commands like break, next, step, bt and run.
