It was a short day for me there was only the last few hrs if the day to work but it was fun today.

Since the last week exercises are provided i'm kind of excited by now and i got something i think that will be usefull for it from the google python class day2 part3

The exercise copyspecial.py was completed successfully and uploaded to the github directory

The video day2 part3 is an superb one i think it will be fun to work with the url module the last exercise is pending hope i can finish it tomorrow and start working with the project
